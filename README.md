🧠 ML Model Comparison on Store Sales Data

This project compares multiple machine learning models on the [Stores Area and Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/stores-area-and-sales-data) to predict high sales performance based on store features.

🚀 Objective
1.Train multiple ML models

2.Evaluate using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

3. Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

4. Select the best performing model

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Jupyter Notebooks
Matplotlib, Seaborn
